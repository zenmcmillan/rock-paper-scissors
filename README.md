# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Abstract: 

The user is first taken to a page where they can click the Classic or Hard Buttons respectively to pick they game they want to play. The rules for the game are in the box with the classic or Hard buttons. When an icon is clicked the players emoji will show up underneath their clicked piece.   After a few seconds the emoji as well as the other icons will disappear besides the users clicked piece and the computers randomly generated piece. The winner will be announced above the game. The game resets and the wins on tracked on each side of the screen for the user and computer.

## Learning Goals:

* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of: DRY Javascript

* Event delegation to handle similar event listeners

* Understand the difference between the data model    and how the data is displayed on the DOM

* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a logical challenge

## Wins

* Having the DOM rely completely on the data model

## Challenges

* At first was very challenging for me to show the correct icons on the screen and have them be in the position that I wanted them to be in. I got completely stuck when there was a draw between the user and the computer. I realized that while the data for wins and losses were being tracked properly. The icons themselves were not rendered from the data model. After I fixed that the project was smooth sailing! üòä
